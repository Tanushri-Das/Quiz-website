# Explanation of my Website
* : I am building an Educational Website called WebTesty.We were given an API and depended on that API to load the data and show all the topics through the cards.Each card has a button.
* : Clicking each button will show the topic related quizzes that we are loading through the API.While giving the quizzes , if the user selects the correct answer , then a toast will open where it will say the correct answer and if the user selects the wrong answer  ,it will also be shown with a toast.
* : While giving a quiz on each individual topic , there id an eye icon in each individual quiz question,which on click will tell the answer in a toast.A chart will be displayed if you click on Statistics.I am loading the data here using the API provided to us.
* : There were total four topics and I am preparing these four topics depending on the total quiz in each of the four topics.After clicking on the blog will take you to the blog's route.There are three questions and their answers are given there.This website is responsive for phone and desktop.That's all.





<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
